\section{Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:systematics}
%%% Intro
Understanding and minimising the impact of all the possible sources of systematic uncertainties is essential for any
meaningful measurement to be made, especially 
%%% Sources
There are two 

These uncertainties, as well as the statistical uncertainties arising from the size of the simulated samples available, have been treated as nuisance parameters in the statistical fit model, as discussed in~\ref{chapter:results}.

\section{Experimental Uncertainties}
\subsection{Jet Energy Corrections}
As it has been observed that there are differences between simulated and jet energies , 
corrections are

\subsection{Pileup Reweighting}
The \PU interactions included in the simulated samples used do not describe the number of primary interactions observed in data well, these interactions are estimated 
As such, they are reweighted to 

\subsection{b-tagging Uncertainties}
The B-Tag and Vertexing (BTV) Physics Object Group measures the b-tagging efficiency and misidentification rates for b and light flavoured jets in data and MC simulation (multijet and \ttbar) of the algorithms which they support~\cite{Sirunyan:2017ezt}.
From these measurements b-tagging efficiency scale factors are produced and provided for analysts to apply to simulated events to correct differences observed between data and simulation.
These scale factors, as functions of the jet flavour, \pT and $\eta$, to alter the weight of the selected MC events.
This methodology was chosen as it involves only changing the weight of the selected MC events which, unlike other methods, avoids events migrating into different b-tag multiplicity bins and the potential issue of events with undefined variables (such as \editComment{INSERT EXAMPLE HERE WHEN LESS SLEEPY}).
The uncertainties of the scale factors applied are obtained by varying their value by $\pm 1\sigma$, as calculated by the BTV POG.

\subsection{Parton Distribution Functions}

\subsection{Non-prompt Lepton Contributions}
As this data-driven estimate of the instrumental backgrounds should have no dependence on either the lepton flavour or selection cuts, the variation of the ratio of opposite-sign over same-sign events as a function of the lepton flavour and the cut level should be well accounted for by a 30\% systematic uncertainty.

\subsection{Luminosity Uncertainties}
CMS uses five detectors, the pixel detector, DTs, HF, the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor and Pixel Luminosity Telescope to monitor and measure the instantaneous and integrated luminosity, with absolute calibrations of the detectors made through conducting Van der Meer (VdM) scans during dedicated LHC runs.
The luminosity value and its associated uncertainty used was determined by the CMS Luminosity Group using 
Pixel Cluster Counting (PCC) 

The overall uncertainty \cite{CMS:2017_lumi} %2016 lumi
\subsection{Lepton Efficiencies}
In order to account for the difference in performance for lepton trigger, identification, isolation and reconstruction efficiencies 

The lepton trigger efficiencies for both channels are measured independently, 

\section{Theoretical Uncertainties}

\subsection{Parton Density Functions}
%%Discussion of what PDFs are, is given in an earlier chapter
In order to calculate the uncertainties on the PDFs used in the generation of the MC samples considered, the

\section{Impact of the Uncertainties}
The effect of each of the systematics considered on the event rate, in percentage, are shown in Table~\ref{tab:systImpact}.
These rates, whilst providing a useful insight into which of the systematics are the most important, do not show how the shape of each fitted variable and the MVA discriminant is influenced by each uncertainty.
