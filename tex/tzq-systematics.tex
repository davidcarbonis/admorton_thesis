\section{Data and Simulation Samples}\label{sec:samples}
Out of the 37.8\fbinv of  proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ collected by the CMS experiment during 2016, 35.8\fbinv was certified by the collaboration as being of sufficient quality to be used for physics analysis.

The difference between the certified value and the total data recorded is the result of various factors such as the unavailability of a detector due to power failures .

Due to the prescaling of all of the electron triggers considered during the start of the most luminous runs, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:triggerStrategy}, the $ee$ channel uses a reduced dataset of 35.6\fbinv where none of the triggers considered were prescaled.
Events in the double lepton and single lepton datasets from across these ``good'' data runs are considered where the double and single lepton triggers respectively have fired, using the strategy described in Section~\ref{sec:triggerStrategy}.

The MC samples used to model both the model signal and background processes considered here are listed in table~\ref{tab:mcList}.
For each of the processes considered, the table which includes information on the number of events generated, the cross section used in their generation and the order in perturbative accuracy in QCD to which the generators calculated the processes.
For all the MC samples considered, the hadronisation perfrmed was undertaken using PYTHIA 8.
The NNPDF3.0 family of PDF sets~\cite{Ball:2012cx} was used as for sample generation, where the exact set chosen depended on whether the sample was produced at LO or NLO and used either the four or five flavour scheme.

\section{Simulation Corrections}\label{sec:simCorrections}
Simulation is unable to fully recreate all the effects observed in data, either because certain parameters are not precisely known or cannot be calculated.
To account for possible discrepancies, corrective scale factors are used to reweight MC samples on a per event basis.
If required, scale factors are usually derived as a function of \pt and $\eta$ so as to fully account for the variation of the detector response in both.
These scale factors are used to correct the simulation for any discrepencies in the lepton identification, isolation and reconstruction efficiencies, lepton and jet energy scales and resolutions, b-tagging efficiencies, the poor modelling of pileup in simulation, and the detector resolutions observed in data.

\subsection{Miscalibrated Tracker APV}\label{subsec:hipEffect}
During the first half of data taking in 2016 the silicon strip detector suffered from an instantaneous-luminosity-dependent hit finding inefficiency, which particularly affected high occupancy regions, due to saturation in the pre-amplifier in the front-end electronics~\cite{Fiori:2016ebh}.
This issue was resolved by changing the configuration of the electronics.
The 55\% of the total dataset affected by this issue has since been reprocessed by CMS to mitigate the impact on the quality of the data taken.

Despite this however, there is still a negative impact on the reconstructing tracks efficiency for physics objects that rely upon tracking data.

This reduced detector efficiency is accounted for by using the weighted average of the scale factors that have been derived separately for both the affected and unaffected portions of the dataset.

\subsection{Lepton Efficiency}\label{subsec:leptonRecoSFs}
The identification, isolation and reconstruction efficiencies of leptons are calculated using measurements of $Z \rightarrow l^{+} l ^{-}$ events with the \emph{tag-and-probe} method~\cite{CMS:2008rxa}.
Using events within a dilepton invariant mass window to ensure a high purity, from this large statistics lepton sample, the method ``tags'' and ``probes'' the leptons where one has passed a tight and the other a loose selection criteria.
For source of each efficiency and lepton flavour, the efficiency is given as the fraction of events where the probe leptons passed the relevant selection criteria.
This methodology is used to create corrective scale factors for each component and these are multiplicatively applied to each leptons' event weight as functions of their \pt, $\eta$, and flavour.

The triggers efficiencies for the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ final states were calculated by considering events that pass triggers which are weakly correlated with all of the lepton triggers considered, known as \emph{cross triggers} (X triggers).
By counting these events and whether or not they pass at least one of the lepton triggers considered for the relevant final state, the trigger efficiency is estimated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{trigger} = \frac{N_{X triggers + lepton triggers}}{N_{X triggers}} \;
\end{equation}

where $N_{X trigger}$ is the number of events that have passed the analysis' lepton selection criteria and the cross triggers, and $N_{X triggers + lepton triggers}$ is $N_{X trigger}$ and the number of events that additionally passed at least one of the lepton triggers for the relevant lepton flavour.

As the trigger requirements are applied to both simulated and data events, a scale factor of the ratio of the trigger efficiency in data and in simulation is calculations and used to weight the simulation.
For both the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels in the signal region and the $e \mu$ channel for the \ttbar control region, a constant scale factor was found to be sufficient to account for the differences between data and simulation.

The efficiencies were determined using data and simulated \ttbar events.
The resultant trigger efficiency scale factors applied to simulation are given in table~\ref{tab:triggerSFs} with their associated statistical uncertainties.
The associated systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.

\subsection{Lepton Energy Corrections}\label{subsec:leptonEnergyCorrections}
\subsubsection{Electron Regression and Energy Scale and Smearing Corrections}
Two types of energy corrections that have been produced by the CMS ElectronGamma (EGM) Physics Object Group are applied to electrons and photons.
These energy regression and energy scale and smearing corrections use $Z \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-}$ events 
WHAT DO THEY CORRECT 

These corrections are applied to both MC simulation and data and are used to improve the electron resolution obtained and to resolve the observed discrepancies between them.

Using simulation for tuning, energy regression obtains the best possible energy resolution by using the detector information to correct the reconstructed object energy.
The disagreement between data and MC is resolved by scaling the data energy to the MC energy scale and smearing the MC so that it has the same energy resolution as data. 

These corrections are pre-applied onto the PF electron collections used.

\subsubsection{Rochester Corrections}
The muon momentum scale and resolution correction methods developed by the University of Rochester~\cite{rochester}, known as \emph{Rochester Corrections}, are used to remove any muon momentum bias arising from any possible detector misalignment and any error in the measurement of the magnetic field for both MC and data.
These corrections are derived using a sample of high \pt $> 20\GeVc$ muons from Z $ \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays using a two-step method.
The first of the two steps determines a correction factor that is defined as the difference in the mean inverse transverse momenta of the muons from a perfectly aligned simulation and reconstructed data or simulation.
These corrections are tuned in the second step using the $M_{\mu^mu}$ peak for a perfectly aligned detector to calibrate the corrections.
This removes any dependence on detector efficiency or physics modelling.

The Rochester Corrections are applied to each muon as an event weight that is a function of the muon's charge, \pt, $\eta$ and $\phi$.

\subsection{Jet Energy Corrections}\label{subsec:jesjer}
As described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:JECs}, the Jet Energy Corrections are applied to account for the non-uniform response in \pT and $\eta$ of the detector by comparing the differences between the generator level and detector level responses in simulation and any residual differences between simulation and data.

In addition to these corrections, as the Jet Energy Resolution (JER) observed in data is approximately 10\% poorer than that observed in simulation, the 4-vectors of simulated jets are smeared as functions of generator level and reconstructed \pt and $\eta$ to account for this~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdb}.

\subsection{b-tagging Efficiency}\label{subsec:btagEff}
The CMS B-Tag and Vertexing (BTV) Physics Object Group measures the b-tagging efficiency and misidentification rates for b- and light-flavoured jets in data and MC simulation (multijet and \ttbar) of the algorithms which they support~\cite{Sirunyan:2017ezt}.
From these measurements b-tagging efficiency scale factors are produced and provided for analysts to apply to simulated events to correct for differences observed between data and simulation.
These scale factors, as functions of the jet flavour, \pT and $\eta$, are used to alter the weight of the MC events.
This methodology was chosen as it involves only changing the weight of the selected MC events which, unlike other methods, avoids events migrating into different b-tag multiplicity bins and having events with potentially undefined variables such as the top mass.

\subsection{\PU Modelling}\label{subsec:puSF}
It is challenging to model variations in the number of \PU interactions that result from the changing LHC conditions.
To achieve this, MC events are reweighted as a function of the number of primary vertices so that the simulated PU distributions resemble those observed in data.

The \PU SF is determined as a function of the number of primary vertices, $n_{PV}$, by comparing the $n_{PV}$ distribution in minimum bias data over the running period considered to the corresponding $n_{PV}$ distribution in simulated events.

\subsection{Top quark \pt}
A scale factor is used to reweight all simulated \ttbar events to account for the differences in the top quark \pt distribution observed between data and both the LO and NLO MC simulation~\cite{Khachatryan:2015oqa}.

\section{Signal Region Simulated Backgrounds}\label{sec:simBackgrounds}
The impact of the application of the full event selection and simulation corrections in the signal region on the simulated samples, including non-prompt lepton contribution estimated from data, compared to data is shown in table~\ref{tab:signalYields}.

While jet cleaning and tight isolation criteria for leptons has significantly reduced the non-prompt lepton contributions, completely removing the W+jets process, the signal region is still dominated by a number of background processes.
The two dominant background processes are Z+jets and \ttbar, with contributions of a similar order to tZq from the single top tW-channel, \ttbarZ, WZ and ZZ processes.
The remaining single top (tHq, tWZ, s-channel, t-channel), \ttbarW, \ttbarH, WW and triboson backgrounds produce contributions smaller than the signal process.

\section{Data-driven Background Estimation}\label{sec:dataDrivenBackground}

\subsection{Non-Prompt Leptons}\label{sec:NPLs}
Leptons that are produced from events where at least one jet is incorrectly reconstructed as a lepton (predominately electrons) or a lepton from the decay of heavy quarks (predominately muons) are known as \emph{non-prompt leptons} (NPLs).
The majority of these events are produced by semi-leptonic \ttbar decays, and W+jets production, with smaller contributions from QCD and single top production.
As it is difficult to accurately model QCD processes and very few events from the simulated processes that pass the lepton selection  could result in an inaccurate estimate of such processes from simulation alone, 

the NPL contribution is estimated with data.

This data-driven estimate is based on the methodology used in top quark pair production~\cite{CMS:2016syx} and same charge SUSY searches~\cite{CMS:2015vqc}.
This approach takes advantage of the fact that the vast majority of events containing same charge lepton pairs result from non-prompt and charge misidentified leptons, with some contributions from prompt leptons (such as \ttV).
As these backgrounds are independent of the charge of the lepton pairs, it is expected that the nominal opposite charge event selection would have a contribution with a similar magnitude.

Thus, by inverting the signal region's opposite charge lepton pair requirement (\ie by requiring the leptons to have the same, not opposite, charge), a same sign control region can be defined that is dominated by NPL events while containing a small admixture of from prompt lepton events, charge misidentification and real same charge lepton pairs.

Using this control region, a data-driven estimate of the contribution of opposite charge NPLs can be derived as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:NPL}
N_{data}^{OS non-prompt} = (N_{data}^{SS} - N^{SS}_{real + mis-ID}) \cdot \frac{N_{MC}^{OS non-prompt}}{N_{MC}^{SS non-prompt}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{data}^{SS}$ is the total number of same sign events observed in data and $N^{SS}_{real + mis-ID}$ is the expected number of real same sign events and events with charge misidentification.

The ratio of opposite sign and same sign NPLs in simulation, $N_{MC}^{OS non-prompt}$ and $N_{MC}^{SS non-prompt}$, respectively, is used to appropriately normalise this estimate and uses the generator level information in simulation to correctly identify how the leptons were produced.
The W+jets, \ttZ, \ttW, and single top simulated samples that have sufficient statistics in the same sign control region are used to calculate this ratio as these simulation indicates that these processes are the predominant source of non-prompt leptons for this analysis.

The event yields of the simulated samples and data following the full event selection in the same lepton sign control region, the same sign background contributions not accounted for by simulation, ratio of same charge to opposite charge event yields and the data-driven NPL contribution estimate are given in table~\ref{tab:fakeLeptonYields}.

\subsection{Z+jets Background}\label{subsec:zPlusJetsEstimation}
Following the application of the full event selection and simulation corrections in the signal region both the Madgraph (LO) and aMC@NLO (NLO) Z+jets samples listed in table~\ref{tab:mcList} were compared.

In contrast to the correct normalisation of Madgraph Z+jets samples that was seen in the signal region and both of the Z+jets control regions, it was observed that there was a dramatic normalisation offset for the aMC@NLO Z+jets samples.

Figures~\ref{fig:zPlusCR_nJets},~\ref{fig:zPlusCR_leadJetPt},~\ref{fig:zPlusCR_secJetPt},~\ref{fig:zPlusCR_thirdJetPt} and ~\ref{fig:zPlusCR_fourthJetPt} show that that despite this scaling issue, the aMC@NLO Z+jets samples did better describe the higher jet multiplicities and the kinematics of the four leading jets in the nominal Z+jets control region defined in Section~\ref{subsec:zPlusJetsCR}.

\end{figure}

Following observing this normalisation offset, a number of alternative Z+jets samples which were binned as a function of the Z boson's \pT and the number of jets produced by the hard process were also considered.
In contrast to the nominal Z boson mass binned samples, the alternative Z+jets samples generated by Madgraph and aMC@NLO were found to poorly describe the shapes of Z boson and jet distributions.
Consequently, these alternative samples were not considered as viable replacements of the Z boson mass binned Z+jets samples.

As having a NLO description of this large multi-jet background was highly desirable in light of the event selection requirements, it was decided to use nominal Z+jets control region to determine the correct normalisation of the aMC@NLO Z+jets samples.
This was achieved by simultaneously fitting this background in the control region at the same time as the signal region fit was performed.

\subsection{\ttbar Background}\label{subsec:ttbarEstimation}
The \ttbar enriched control region, as defined in Section~\ref{subsec:ttbarCR}, was designed to provide an orthogonal region which was topologically similar to the signal region in order to validate:
\begin{itemize}
\item whether or not the simulated \ttbar sample used accurately modelled the \ttbar process;
\item and if not, to be used to derive a data-driven estimate for \ttbar.
\end{itemize}

As good agreement was observed between data and MC simulation for both the overall normalisation and the shapes of individual variables, it was determined that a data-driven estimate of the \ttbar contribution was unnecessary.

Examples of this good agreement between simulation and data for the number of jets, number of b-tagged jets, jet \pT for the leading four jets, invariant mass of the W boson ``candidate'', the leptons' \pt and invariant mass and \pt are given in figures~\ref{fig:ttbarCR_nJets},~\ref{fig:ttbarCR_jetPt}, and~\ref{fig:ttbarCR_leptons}.

\section{Multivariate Analysis Techniques}\label{sec:mvas}
Multivariate Analysis (MVA) techniques are commonly used 

to further enhance the separation between signal and background processes given the difficulty in identifying rare or background dominated processes through the sole use of individual cuts.

Therefore, given the small cross section and topology of the dilepton final state of tZq, a MVA technique was used to enhance the separation between the signal and background following the application of the selection cuts described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:tzq-search}.
\emph{Boosted Decision Trees}~(BDTs) were chosen for this analysis as they were found to give superior performance compared to other MVA techniques and they are a widely used and supported technique with CMS existing expertise.

\subsection{Boosted Decision Trees}\label{subsec:bdt}
Figure~\ref{fig:decisionTree} illustrates a simple decision tree, where a series of sequential binary decisions (nodes) are made on a single input variable (\emph{feature}), $x_{i}$, until a final decision is made at a \emph{leaf node} and the object is classified as either signal or background.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{figs/background-estimation/decisionTree.pdf}
\caption{A simple decision tree where repeated cuts on the variables $x$ are perfomed until a leaf node is reached and the object is classified as either signal (s) or background (b)~\cite{Hocker:2007ht}.
}
\label{fig:decisionTree}
\end{figure}

As the decision criterion for each node is dependent on the decisions of the preceding nodes, decision trees have the potential to obtain better separation between signal and background processes through individual cuts on isolated variables.

Without any prior knowledge of the system however, a single isolated tree is not expected to be an efficient classifier.
Despite this however, such a weak learner will still contain some knowledge about the underlying structure of the classification problem.
\emph{Boosting} aims to exploit this knowledge by using an ensemble of repeatedly trained weak learners to produce a more effective classifier.
Following each training iteration the dataset is reweighted based on the success of the previous classifiers in order to force the weak learners to attempt to classify harder to identify objects.
At the end of this process a weighted average (based) of all the weak learners are combined to produce a single strong learner.

\emph{Bagging} is a similar concept to boosting, but involves each weak learner being trained on a random subset of the training sample, such that every element has an equal probability of being sampled, rather than the whole training sample.

Therefore by extending boosting (or bagging) to decision trees, the resultant forest of \emph{Boosted Decision Trees} produces a classifier that is both much more effective and resilient to fluctuations in the training sample than one created by a single tree.

Typically the classifier produced by a BDT takes the form of a single discriminator whose response ranges between -1 to +1, denoting completely background-like and signal-like objects, respectively.


Two of the most common boosting algorithms used with decision trees are the Adaptive Boosting (\emph{AdaBoost})~\cite{Friedman:additivelogistic} and \emph{Gradient Boosting}~\cite{Friedman:greedyfunction,Friedman:GradientBoosting} algorithms.
Adaboost adjusts the weighting assigned to both  misclassified objects and the best performing weak learners after each iteration so that the best learners are trained to correctly identify the most difficult objects.
In contrast, gradient boosting uses gradient descent following each iteration to determine the residuals of the objects in order to focus on correctly classifying the objects with the largest residuals.

Despite their effectiveness however, BDTs are potentially sensitive to the effects of \emph{overtraining}.
This phenomena occurs when BDT is overly optimised on correctly classifying the training dataset and results in the poor classification of unseen data.
To minimise the impact of any potential overtraining, the signal and background process samples are split into training and testing samples, where the latter samples are used to check the validity of the BDT trained with the former.
A description of the training and testing method used to validate both the optimisation of the selection of the hyperparameters and whether or not they were overtrained is given in Section~\ref{subsec:hyperparameters}.


Following a number of studies evaluating:

\begin{itemize}
\item a number of boosting algorithms for decision trees;
\item which simulated background processes should be included in the training processes;
\item whether or not multiple BDTs trained on separate backgrounds would be more effective than a single BDT;
\item how to determine which features possessed the greater discriminating power;
\item and which \emph{hyperparameters}, the set of options used to determine how a BDT grows, and their values gave the optimal classification performance;
\end{itemize}

it was determined that the \emph{eXtreme Gradient Boosting} (XGBoost) implementation of the Gradiant Boost alogorithm for a single BDT trained on all the MC simulation samples gave the optimal performance for this search~\cite{xgboost}.

The methods used for selecting the features and model hyperparameters are described in the following subsections.
Both the input features and model hyperparameters were chosen separately for $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels and all the simulated MC samples were considered.

\subsection{BDT Input Features}
From the selected reconstructed physics objects, a large number of input variables or \emph{features} were constructed and considered as potential inputs for the BDT.
A recursive feature elimination was used to determine the set of features which gave the optimal performance.

The features chosen by recursive feature elimination for the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels are given in table~\ref{tab:selectedBdtVariables}.
Figure~\ref{fig:inputFeaturesDistributions} shows the distributions of the selected features in the signal and background samples.
Figures~\ref{fig:inputFeaturesDataSimAgreement} show the good agreement observed between simulation and data for the combination of the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels for the features selected, validating their validity as reliable features.
Table~\ref{tab:allBdtVariables} in Appendix~\ref{app:bdt} provides a list of all the features that were considered.

\subsection{BDT Model Hyperparameters}\label{subsec:hyperparameters}
The choice 
Instead of tuning the choice hyperparmeters for optimal classification performance either by hand or a time and computationally expensive grid search, the minima of a classification quality metric based on the AUROC, $f(\theta)$, were found.

%These minima were evaluated using the \emph{Scikit-Optimize} library~\cite{scikit-optimise} to construct a regression model based on a Gaussian process with the Mat\'{e}rn $\nu =\frac{5}{2}$ kernel.
%Initially this model evaluates $f$ using random values of $\theta$ for fifteen iterations before values of $\theta$ are chosen based on the regression model.
%
%In order to robustly train the classifier, for each of the 150 training iterations performed $f(\theta)$ was evaluated across four subsets of the training data using the the k-fold cross-validation scheme.
%These subsets were formed of 80\% of the total data which was randomly split between the four folds, with the remaining 20\% of the data being reserved for later testing.
%Following evaluating $f$ four times, where a different fold was withheld each time, the resultant average $f$ was taken as the final metric.
%Out of the 150 averaged final metrics, the classifier with the best $(\theta)$ was retrained on all of the training data, checked against the reserved test data, and if satisfactory, used to produce the optimal BDT.

\subsection{BDT Output}
Following the optimisation of both the BDT features and the choice of hyperparameters for both the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ channels independently, the optimal BDT is trained.
The resultant BDT is used to produce the output distribution of the BDT discriminator for each of the data and simulation samples considered, including the systematic shape uncertainties.
The resultant BDT discriminator distributions are used to perform a measurement of the signal strength and to attempt an extraction of the signal's cross section.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:systematics}
%%% Intro
For any meaningful and robust measurement to be made in any physics analysis, it is vital that the sources of systematic uncertainties associated with it are both understood and controlled.
This is particularly important when searching for tZq dilepton final state given that the high statistics of the background processes result in their systematic uncertainties being of a comparable order to the statistical uncertainties of the signal process.
Therefore without additional data to reduce the statistical uncertainty, the sensitivity of the search will be limited by the systematic uncertainties.

%%% Sources
These sources of uncertainty either originate from experimental or theoretical uncertainties and typically influence the result in one of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rate or normalisation uncertainties} impact the number of events present and thus influence the  normalisation of the distributions considered.
\item \textbf{Shape or scale factor uncertainties} impact the shape of the distributions as they involve the scaling of individual events as a function of their kinematics in order to correct inconsistencies between simulation and data.
\end{itemize}

The statistical uncertainties arising from the size of the simulated samples available are also considered.

These uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters in the statistical fit model which is described, along with the impact of the uncertainties on the result, in Section~\ref{sec:statisticalModel}.

\subsection{Experimental Uncertainties}
\subsubsection{Jet Energy Corrections}
The CMS Jet Energy Corrections group provides the uncertainties associated with the JES and JER values they determine (discussed in Sections~\ref{subsubsec:JECs} and~\ref{subsec:jesjer})~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdb}. 

The impact of the JES is evaluated by varying the JES values applied to all jets up and down by a standard deviation.
The uncertainty associated with the JER smearing is accounted for by varying the smearing factor up and down by the associated statistical uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Missing Transverse Energy Uncertainties}
As missing transverse energy is calculated from the sum of the \pT of all PF objects in a given event along with the remaining unclustered energy deposits, the uncertainties associated from both have to be considered.

The impact of the uncertainties associated with both the JES and JER on the PF \MET are accounted for by propagating the JEC uncertainties through to the \MET and evaluating the impact they have.
As the unclustered energy remains uncorrected, the impact on the \MET uncertainty is evaluated by varying the contributions to the unclustered energy from each particle by their respective resolution.

\subsubsection{Pileup Reweighting}
The uncertainty associated with the primary vertex distributions used in the \PU reweighting is determined by varying the expected minimum bias cross section used in simulation $\pm X\%$ in order to ascertain the impact of greater or lesser amounts of \PU on the analysis.

\subsubsection{Parton Density Functions}\label{subsec:pdfSysts}
%%Discussion of what PDFs are, is given in an earlier chapter 
The impact of the PDF uncertainties are evaluated according to PDF4LHC recommendations~\cite{Butterworth:2015oua}, namely as the standard deviation of the weights of the nominal and the variations of the PDF set.

For almost all of the MC samples considered, this is achieved by considering the nonimal event weight and one hundred alternative PDF weights which are stored as per-event weights in the LHE 
event header for almost all of the MC samples considered.

The single top tW-channel samples are the exception to this as at the time of their generation it was not possible to generate the required per-event weights.
In this case, the LHAPDF (Les Houches Accord Parton Distribution Function) library is used to access both the nominal PDF weight and the 50 eigenvalues from the NNPDF3.0 set needed to provide one hundred alternative event weights.

\subsubsection{b-tagging Uncertainties}
The uncertainties associated with the b-tagging scale factors described in Section~\ref{subsec:btagEff} are obtained by varying their value by $\pm 1\sigma$.

\subsubsection{Non-prompt Lepton Contributions}
The data-driven estimate of the instrumental backgrounds should have no dependence on either the lepton flavour or selection cuts.
Therefore the variation of the ratio of opposite-sign over same-sign events as a function of the lepton flavour and the cut level was considered to be well accounted for by a 30\% rate uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Z+jets Background}
The uncertainty associated with the normalisation of the aMC@NLO Z+jets background sample was evaluated by the \combine tool used to calculate the results discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:results}.
As \combine performs a simultaneous fit of the Z+jets background enriched control region and the signal region, it incorporates the impact of the statistical uncertainty on the fit of the Z+jets control region as a nuisance parameter that controls the normalisation in the final signal region fit.

\subsubsection{Luminosity Uncertainties}
CMS uses the pixel detector, DTs, HF, the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor and Pixel Luminosity Telescope to monitor and measure the instantaneous and integrated luminosity.
During Run 2, the primary offline luminosity measurements made by the CMS Luminosity Group used the pixel detector using the Pixel Cluster Counting (PCC) method due its stability over time for up an average \PU of 150 and the high precision results obtained with it during Run I.
The PCC algorithm is able to achieve such a precision by measuring the instantaneous luminosity through the number of pixels present. 
This is possible as the probability of pixel hit belonging to multiple tracks is very small due to the very low occupancy of the detector, inferring that the number of pixel hits are linearly proportional to the number of interactions during a bunch crossing~\cite{CMS:2017_lumi}.

Using Van der Meer (VdM) scans during dedicated LHC runs to calibrate the absolute luminosity scale calibrations of the detectors~\cite{vanderMeer:1968zz}

%%%%


The overall uncertainty in the integrated luminosity collected by CMS in 2016 was estimated to be 2.5\%~\cite{CMS:2017_lumi}.

%The MC events produced are weighted by a scale factor in order to correctly normalise them with respect to the data they are compared against.
%This normalisation scale factor is given by:
%\begin{equation}
%SF_{dataset} = \frac{\pazocal{L} \sigma}{N_{MC}^{Events}}
%\end{equation}
%where $\pazocal{L}$ is the amount of total integrated luminosity considered in the data used, $\sigma$ the cross section of the MC sample considered and $N_{MC}^{Events}$ is number of simulated events considered for the process.

\subsubsection{Lepton Efficiencies}
The uncertainties associated with the lepton identification, isolation and reconstruction efficiency scale factors discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:leptonRecoSFs} are varied by $\pm \sigma$.

Several systematic studies were performed to estimate the systematic uncertainty for the trigger scale factors.
These studies included the comparison of the trigger efficiencies in simulation for \ttbar and Z+jets amd the independence of the \MET trigger selection.
As shown in table~\ref{tab:zPlusTriggerSFs} the differences in the triggers efficiencies observed in all the  channels are so small that they are covered by their statistical uncertainties.

 \end{tabular}%}
\end{table}

In order to evaluate the independence between the \MET and lepton triggers used, one first considers the efficiency of each set of triggers independently.
If both sets triggers are independent, then the efficiency of fulfilling both trigger selections can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{X + lepton triggers} = \epsilon_{X triggers} \times \epsilon_{lepton triggers}
\label{eq:triggerCorrelation}
\end{equation}

If the \MET and lepton trigger selections are uncorrelated, then the ratio of the left and right hand sides ($\alpha$) of equation~\ref{eq:triggerCorrelation} will be 1.
Table~\ref{tab:triggerCorrelation} shows that for the all the channels, $\alpha$ only exhibits small differences from unity, indicating negligible correlation between the triggers used.

Given the statistical uncertainties involved and the results of the studies briefly described above, it was determined that associating a systematic uncertainty of 1.0\%, 1.0\% and 2\% for the triggers used for the $ee$, $\mu\mu$, and $e \mu$ channels would be sufficient.

\subsection{Theoretical Uncertainties}\label{sec:theorySysts}
\subsubsection{Factorisation and renormalisation scales}
The factorisation and renormalisation scales ($\mu_{f}$,$\mu_{s}$) used at the Matrix Element and Parton Shower levels are parametrised as functions of $Q^{2}$. \editComment{WHAT IS Q2?}
ISR : q^2 =  muR^2 = z(1-z)q^2; q^2 = -p^2
FSR q^2 =  muR^2 = z(1-z)q^2; q^2 = p^2-m_0^2

In order to consider the impact of the uncertainty associated with the choice of scales used, $Q^{2}$ is varied up and down by factors of 2 and 0.5 respectively.

For the majority of the MC samples considered, the variations in $\mu_{f}$ and $\mu_{s}$ are stored in the LHE event header as per-event weights.
These weights are produced for where one scale is fixed as the other is varied or both are varied simultaneously.
The event weights for the simultaneously varied scales were used to reweighting each event in order to evaluate the impact of the $\mu_{f}$ and $\mu_{s}$ uncertainties.

In contrast to the ME level, the impact of the PS shower scale uncertainties was evaluated through the use of dedicated samples where the PS scale had been varied up and down.
These centrally produced samples are listed in Table~\ref{tab:theorySampleList} as the ``scale up'' and ``scale down'' samples.
\editComment{What is ISR/FSR? What does varying it do?}
In the case of \ttbar however, these samples are listed as ISR (initial-state radiation) and FSR (final-state radiation), as it includes the variations in the gluon emissions of the incoming and outgoing partons.

As mentioned above in Section~\ref{subsec:pdfSysts}, it was not possible for the single top tW-channel MC samples to be produced with per-event weights to account for the matrix element factorisation and renormalisation scales.
Dedicated samples for this process, listed in Table~\ref{tab:theorySampleList}, where the matrix element and parton shower scales are varied are used to evaluate these systematic uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Parton Shower Matching Thresholds}
As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:eventGenerators}, all of the MC samples considered use model the hard scattering process through a dedicated Matrix Element generator, with PYTHIA 8 being used to perform the subsequent PS and hadronisation.
Dedicated samples evaluate the impact of the uncertainty associated with the choice of the matching threshold for the \ttbar and single top t-channel backgrounds generated with POWHEG, listed in table~\ref{tab:theorySampleList}.
For these samples, the model's matching threshold parameter \emph{hdamp} is varied up and down by one standard deviation, effectively 

The uncertainty associated with the choice of the matching threshold for  quark samplse used is evaluated by using dedicated matching samples where the model's matching threshold parameter \emph{hdamp} is varied up and down by one standard deviation~\cite{CMS:2016kle}.

\subsection{Pre-Fit Impact of the Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:uncertainitiesPreFitImpact}
The impact of the each of the systematics on the event yield (in percentage) of the simulated processes is shown in Table~\ref{tab:systImpact}.
These rates, whilst giving an overview of which systematics are the most important, do not show how the shape of the fitted variable, the BDT discriminant, is influenced by each uncertainty.
To estimate the effect of each uncertainty on the final result, the extraction of the limits was performed, fixing each uncertainty one at a time.
The difference in the error on the limit with the uncertainty fixed, and with it allowed to float, is attributed to the individual uncertainty source.
