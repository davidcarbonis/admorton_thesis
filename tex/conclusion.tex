\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
Following the restart of the LHC in 2015, its increased centre-of-mass collision energies and instantaneous luminosities have made it possible to make undertake measurements of rare processes involving top quark and electroweak interactions.

In this thesis a search was presented for the production of a top quark in association with a Z boson using the dilepton final state using a shape based analysis.
This analysis focussed on understanding the contributions from processes that produce non-prompt leptons and suppressing the Z+jets and \ttbar processes.
A Boosted Decision Tree was used to further enhance the separation between the signal from tZq production and background, using a set of variables that were identified as having the greatest discriminating power.
A cross section of $\sigma (\textrm{tZq}, Z \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}) = XXX^{}_{}$ was measured for the signal process, corresponding to an observed excess over the background-only hypothesis of $5\sigma$.
Using simulation, the expected significance was determined to be $99 \sigma$.

This is both the first measurement and the first evidence that has been found for tZq that has been made using the dilepton final state.

%As this analysis is currently blinded, only the expected upper limit on the cross section for tZq using the dilepton state and its corresponding significance are presented.
%
%The expected upper limit on the tZq cross section was determined to be 189.4 fb, corresponding to an expected significance of $0.95 \sigma$.
%
%This expected result is consistent with the SM prediction and with the measurements of the tZq cross section made by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \TeV$ using the trilepton final state~\cite{Aaboud:2017ylb,Sirunyan:2017nbr}.  
%Once unblinded, this will be the first limit that has been set on tZq production using the dilepton final state.

%%%
As the search for tZq is statistically limited, it is expected that discovery of this process should using the dilepton final state should be achievable by extending the analysis to incorporate additional data collected by the CMS experiment.
Since

This result is based on the February 2017 reprocessing of the 2016 data and September 2016 reprocessing of the corresponding simulation samples.
These datasets have subsequently been reprocessed to incorporate updated jet energy corrections and improved alignments and calibrations of the CMS detector.
Combining these reprocessed datasets with the 2017 dataset should improve the significance of the result to around $999\sigma$.

Addition

Alternative lepton selection and b-tagging algorithms have improved the event selection efficiency of other single top searches and their potential for improving the sensitivity of this analysis deserves investigation.

Once an accurate measurement of the tZq cross section can be made, it should be possible to probe  the strength of the WZ and tZ couplings in this process and compare them to SM predictions.
In addition, limits on FCNC

In order to take full advantage of the high luminosity environment of the HL-LHC, it is planned replace the current CMS tracking detector with one which is capable of contributing information to the CMS Level-1 trigger.
The \emph{TMTT} collaboration proposed a track finder system for the upgraded CMS tracker that identifies track candidates using time-multiplexed Hough Transforms in the \rphi plane, a Kalman Filter to filter these candidates and and precisely fit track parameters to them and a duplicate removal process.
During the development of a hardware demonstrator for a review of three developed track finding systems in 2016, a linearised $\chi^{2}$ track fitting algorithm was explored as an alternative to the \KF.
The linearised $\chi^{2}$ track fitting algorithm was shown to be capable of both fitting precise helix parameters to the tracks found by the \HT and filtering out hits incorrectly assigned to tracks and incorrectly reconstructed tracks.
Following the evaluation and comparison of both the $\chi^{2}$ track fit algorithm and the \KF, it was decided not to continue development of the former algorithm.
This decision was made as it was determined that the \KF filtering and fitting performance was superior than that of the $\chi^{2}$ track fit, particularly in the forward regions.

A number of issues will need to be addressed if the the linearised $\chi^{2}$ track fitting algorithm is to be considered a viable alternative to the other track fitters developed for the \emph{TMTT} project.
While only a small number of track derivatives are required for the calculations in the barrel region, it is uncertain whether there are sufficient resources to tabulate the endcap derivatives required on current hardware.
If it can be demonstrated that current FPGAs can implement this algorithm, it will need to be demonstrated that the $\chi^{2}$ track fitter's performance is competitive with the \KF and \LR.
While it may not be possible to make the $\chi^{2}$ track fitter filter track as effectively as the \KF or \LR , other improvements, such including the fitting of the transverse impact parameter, may improve its competitiveness.



The flexibility for the upgraded tracker to be able to reconstruct tracks down to a lower \pT threshold of 2\GeV is potentially desirable and was initially studied as part of the 2016 demonstrator review.
The ability of the proposed track finding system to reconstruct such low transverse momenta tracks ($2\GeV < \pT < 3\GeV$) was shown to be considerably improved by accounting for the effects of \MS. 
In the case of the \HT, this involved using decreased precision \HT cells to mitigate against scattering causing stubs to be found in adjacent cells.
The \KF's covariance matrix was modified to incorporate the uncertainty in the hit position cased by the effects of \MS.
This involved including a term that described the average scattering angle as a function of \pT, which was as effective as an alternative term that also depended on the layer a hit was found in.

Despite these improvements, there are still a number of key areas that require investigating in order to understand the current limitations of the work done so far and how it may be improved upon.

While the current \MS term in the \KF does produce noticeably improve its performance

Currently it is not understood why the duplicate rate increases near the boundary between normal and reduced precision \HT cells.
This effect needs to be understood before an optimal value for the cell merging threshold can be determined.
The ability of the \KF to account for \MS could be improved by using a scattering constant term that is parameterised in such a way that it accurately took into account the volume of material a track has passed through.
The performance of the \KF could also be further improved by using separate \KF $\chi^{2}$ cuts for the \rphi and \rz planes given that the dominant uncertainty contribution for the former varies depending on $\pT$.

During the 2016 review of the proposed track finding systems 

While the work presented in this thesis forms only a small part of the work undertaken by the large international collaboration of the CMS experiment, 


%Given the limited experimental evidence of BSM physics, a large number of BSM physics models, driven by theoretical and ascetic arguments, have been proposed to account for the shortcomings of the SM.
%While the analysis presented in this thesis concerns the search for a SM process, the tZq cross section is sensitive to modifications of the tZ coupling posited by a number of BSM theories.
%
%As eluded to in Section~\ref{subsec:weakForce}, any flavour changing process involving a neutral weak current in the SM cannot occur at the tree level and requires a loop processes involving a virtual W exchange.
%A number of BSM theories however, introduce top quark FCNC decay contributions at the tree level, such as Supersymmetry (SUSY) models and those proposing additional Higgs doublets and/or quark singlets~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2004wm}.
%The presence of such new tZ couplings would enhance the production rate of both \ttZ and tZq by several orders of magnitude and should be observable at the LHC. 
%As of to date however, no evidence for BSM FCNCs have been observed for the tZ coupling for both single top and \ttbar processes~\cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr}.
