\emph{``If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants''}
\emph{Letter to Robert Hooke FRS, February 15th 1676, by Sir Isaac Newton FRS (1643-1727)}

The idea that nature can be explained through rational explanations, such as the ancient philosophical concepts of \emph{Atomism}and the Ancient Greek's \emph{Classical Elements}, is one that stretches back into time immemorial.
Following the adoption of the scientific method during the scientific revolution of the 17th century, the basis of  exploring the nature of reality is no longer based upon philosophical reasoning but on hypotheses that provide predictions that can tested by empirical evidence.
With each successive generation of scientists building upon and improving on the understanding of those before them with new ideas to amend or propose new theories based on new and more precise measurements, unified descriptions of seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as James Clark Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, have emerged.
This process has taken us from John Dalton's atomic theory and Sir Isaac Newton's Laws of Motion which to our latest and greatest description of nature, the Standard Model of Particle Physics, a theory which describes all of the currently known elementary particles and three of the four fundamental forces.

Increasingly powerful and luminous particle accelerators are used to produce the conditions required to make ever more precise and rarer tests of the experimental predictions of the Standard Model and to search for new physics phenomena beyond it, with their associated particle detectors precisely measuring physically interesting rare and short-lived processes against vast backgrounds of uninteresting events.
A search for such a rare process predicted by the Standard Model, that is sensitive to new physics posited by various theories, and its results and potential future steps is discussed along with the contributions towards a study considering a potential future particle detector upgrade that will require the ability to discriminate in favour of potentially interesting physics against increasingly large backgrounds.
