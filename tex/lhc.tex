\section{The Large Hadron Collider}\label{sec:lhc}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \cite{LHCMachine} is planned to operate the machine at a luminosity up to one order of magnitude higher than obtained with the nominal design in order to fully exploit its scientific potential.  After High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade \cite{hl-lhc-prelim-design-report} is completed, currently expected to be in the year 2026, the instantaneous peak luminosity will increase to $5-7.5 \times {10}^{34}$\percms, corresponding to an average number of proton-proton interactions per 40\MHz bunch crossing, named pileup (PU), of 140 to 200. Targeting a total integrated luminosity of $3000$\fbinv, the HL-LHC will enable precision Higgs measurements, searches for rare processes that may deviate from the standard model, and increases in the discovery reach for new particles with low cross-sections and/or multi-TeV masses.
