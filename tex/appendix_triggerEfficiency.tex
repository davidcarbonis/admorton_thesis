\chapter{Trigger Efficiency Studies Plots}\label{app:triggerEff}
This appendix contains the trigger efficiency measured in data and simulation and the resultant data/MC scale factors that would be required to account for the trigger modelling discrepancies in simulation as functions of the leptons' \pT and $\eta$.

Section~\ref{appSec:triggerEffPlots} shows the distributions for the trigger efficiencies in MC for \ttbar and the MET datasets for 2016 and their resultant scale factors for each of the final states considered in the analysis presented in this thesis.

The distributions for the efficiencies in MC for \ttbar and DY are shown in Section~\ref{appSec:triggerSystPlots}. 
These comparisons were undertaken as part of the systematics studies undertaken to estimate the systematic uncertainty on the trigger scale factors that were determined.
As shown in the distributions below in Section~\ref{appSec:triggerSystPlots}, the differences in the trigger efficiency measured across $\eta$ and for $\pT$ above the lepton trigger thresholds are minimal and are covered by their respective statistical uncertainties.
