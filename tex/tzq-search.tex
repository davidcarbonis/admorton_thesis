\chapter{Analysis Strategy }\label{chapter:tzq-search}
%Following from the ... next chapters of this thesis describe the search for a singly produced top quark in association with a Z boson using the reconstructed proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{13}$ collected by the CMS detector during 2016.
%Using the particles identified and reconstructed, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:data-mc}, 

The first stage of a physics analysis is to determine an event selection based on the topology of the process in order to create a region which is enriched with signal events.
The main challenge in defining a signal enriched region for the dilepton final state of tZq is that its topology is identical to final states of other processes with much larger cross sections, resulting in a background dominated.

A number of selection criteria 


The tZq process at leading order consists of a single top quark, a radiated Z boson and a recoil quark.
Therefore, the final state contains two leptons from the Z boson decay and at least four jets,

\subsection{Event Cleaning}
Following the trigger requirements, a number of filters are applied in order to so that events with beam or detector anomalies which result in anomalous \MET are not considered for use in the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Vertex Filter} - ensures that the primary vertex is well reconstructed by requiring it to be within $|z| \leq 24\cm$ of the interaction point and within $d_{0} < 2\cm$ of the beam line.
\item \textbf{Beam Halo Filter} - whilst the LHC uses collimator blocks to remove beam halos which form around the beam, , the filter removes events with calorimeter and muon chamber energy deposits consistent with ...
\item \textbf{HBHE Noise and Isolation Filters} - removes noise in the HBHE caused by particle interactions in the read-out systems and dead regions.  
\item \textbf{ECAL Trigger Primitive and  Filter} - a number of known ECAL channels lack regular data links and some are masked out for reconstruction, but the L1 trigger primitive readout can be used for approximately 70\% of these channels to estimate the energy deposited. As trigger primitives have a narrower

\item \textbf{Bad Muon Filter} - removes events where a muon is defined as a PF muon, but is still has too low a quality and large \pT to be considered.

\subsubsection{Lepton Isolation}
In order to differentiate between leptons promptly produced at the primary vertex from those that result from hadronic decays, a relative isolation variable $I^{rel}$ is defined.
This isolation variable is defined as the summed energy of all PF particles within a cone around the PF lepton, with the estimated neutral charged pileup contamination, $\rho$, removed, divided by the lepton \pT.

Two different pileup contamination estimation methods are used in the work presented, one for electrons and the other for muons.
For electrons the $\rho$ * effective area pileup alleviation technique is employed.
This involves the estimating the expected energy within the isolation cone from the median energy density per area of pileup contamination ($\rho$), estimated for each event, with the effective area given as a function of the electron's pseudorapidity, which is expressed as: 

\begin{equation}
I^{rel}_{rho * A_{eff}} = \sum p_T(CH) + max (0.0, \sum E_{\rm T}(NH) + \sum E_{\rm T}(Photon) -rho*A_{\rm eff} )/p_T \\
\end{equation}\label{eq:rhoEffA}

Muons use the $\Delta\beta$ pileup alleviation technique, where the average pileup energy inside the cone is estimated as half of that originating from charged hadrons.
This is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
I^{rel}_{\Delta\beta} = \sum p_T(CH) + max (0.0, \sum E_{\rm T}(NH) + \sum E_{\rm T}(Photon) - 0.5 * \sum E_{\rm T}(PU))/p_T \\
\end{equation}\label{eq:deltaBeta}

Where CH is the charged hadrons from the Primary Vertex (PV), NH is the neutral hadrons and PU the charged hadrons from pileup.
\subsubsection{Z Boson Candidate Invariant Mass Requirements}
The presence of a Z boson in the final state requires that two leptons selected must be consistent with a Z boson decay, thus requiring them to have the same flavour and opposite charge and an invariant mass within

\subsubsection{b-tagging Requirements}
For each jet, the CSVv2 tagging algorithm described in Chapter~\ref{subsec:objReco-bJets}, is evaluated to medium WP

Either one or two of the jets present is required to be b-tagged given that the top quark predominantly decays into a bottom quark and the W boson and recoil quark ... 

\subsubsection{W Boson Candidate Invariant Mass Requirements}
In contrast to the previous tZq searches where the W boson decays into a lepton and its associated antineutrino, the W boson in the dilepton final state decays hadronically, allowing for the top quark to be fully reconstructed.
Each possible pair of jets is considered, with the pair with a dijet invariant mass closest to the W boson mass of 80.4\GeVcc being chosen as the W candidate.
The leading b-jet however, is not excluded from consideration as the hardest b-jet is assumed to be produced from the decay of the top quark.

\subsection{Non-Prompt Leptons}\label{subsec:NPLs}
Backgrounds which involve decays into lepton + jets and where at least one jet is incorrectly reconstructed as a lepton (predominately electrons) or a lepton from the decay of heavy quarks (predominately muons), which pass the lepton selection and isolation criteria, are estimated with data.

The estimation of this background uses the same methodology as when performing top quark pair production~\cite{CMS:2016syx} and same-sign SUSY searches~\cite{CMS:2015vqc}.
The vast majority of the same-sign event yields found are the result of non-lepton and charge misidentified leptons, with some contribution from prompt leptons.
As these backgrounds are independent of the charge of the lepton pairs, it is expected that the nominal (opposite-sign) sample would have a similar contribution \cite{CMS:2015vqc}.

To estimate this contribution of opposite-sign non-prompt leptons in data, the same-sign event yields with the expected prompt-lepton contribution subtracted, is multiplied by a ratio of opposite-sign over same-sign non-prompt lepton events taken from MC.

The method requires that the same-sign control region established uses the same selection criteria as the nominal signal region, albeit with same-sign lepton pairs instead of opposite-sign ones.
This control region is dominated by non-lepton lepton events, but also contains contributions from prompt lepton events, charge misidentification and real same-sign pairs.

This data driven estimate is obtained using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
 N_{data}^{OS non-prompt} = (N_{data}^{SS} - N^{SS}_{real + mis-ID}).\frac{N_{MC}^{OS non-prompt}}{N_{MC}^{SS non-prompt}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{data}^{SS}$ is the total number of same sign events observed in data, $N^{SS}_{real + mis-ID}$ is the expected number of real same-sign events and events with charge misidentification and $N_{MC}^{OS non-prompt}$ and $N_{MC}^{SS non-prompt}$ the number of opposite-sign and same-sign non-prompt leptons observed in MC used to appropriately scale the estimate.

This ratio of MC opposite-sign over same-sign events is referred to as R, and is calculated using generator level information from reconstructed objects which have matched to a generator level particle. R is calculated from the W + jets, \ttZ and \ttW leptonic decaying, and single top MC samples with sufficient statistics given that these processes are expected to be the predominant source of non-prompt leptons for this analysis.
