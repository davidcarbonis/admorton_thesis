\chapter{Analysis Strategy and Event Selection}\label{chapter:tzq-search}
The next chapters of this thesis describe the search for the dilepton final state of a singly produced top quark in association with a Z boson (tZq) using the reconstructed proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{13}$ collected by the CMS detector during 2016.
The main challenge for searching for the dilepton final state is that topology is identical to the final states of other processes with much larger cross sections.
In contrast to previous analyses for tZq, which have searched for the trilepton final state~\cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr,Sirunyan:2017nbr}, where backgrounds



which have focussed on the , where both the Z and W bosons decay leptonically, only the Z boson decays leptonically, with the W boson decaying hadronically.


The presence of only two leptons from a Z boson presents the the main challenge for this analysis - 


As 

The first stage of a	 physics analysis is to determine an event selection based on the topology of the process in order to create a region which is enriched with signal events.
This is 


At leading order, tZq consists single top quark, a radiated Z boson and a recoil quark.

As the tZq dilepton final state is distinguished by the presence of exactly two leptons from the Z boson decay, being able to identify these isolated prompt leptons with a high efficiency and a low misidentification rate is essential.

Therefore, the final state contains two leptons from the Z boson decay and at least four jets,

\section{Trigger Strategy}\label{sec:triggerStrategy}
As the search for the dilepton final state for tZq relies on the identification of the two leptons from the Z boson decay, the trigger strategy consists of selecting events from datasets identified by the presence of leptons.
Given that the signal process being searched for is dominated by background processes and will likely be limited by statistics, it is essential to reconstruct and select as many signal events as possible.
To this end both single and double lepton triggers with the lowest possible transverse momenta thresholds are considered 
to ensure that the maximum possible statistics can be obtained over the largest possible phase space.

In addition to the ee and $\mu\mu$ final state for tZq, the muon + electron (MuonEG) dataset, and single electron and muon datasets, are considered for a \ttbar enriched control region discussed in Chapter~\ref{subsec:ttbarCR}. 
This control region uses the e$\mu$ final state to validate the modelling of the \ttbar MC sample used in a region topologically similar to the signal region.

%Whilst the Z boson can decay into a tau anti-tau pair, despite these leptons being simulated and reconstructed in the MC, they are not considered in the event selection for this analysis due to the difficulty simulating them due to their high mass.

\section{Event Cleaning}\label{sec:metFilters}
Following the trigger requirements, a number of filters are applied in order to so that events with beam or detector anomalies which result in anomalous \MET are not considered for use in the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Vertex Filter} - ensures that the primary vertex is well reconstructed by requiring it to be within $|z| \leq 24\cm$ of the interaction point and within $d_{0} < 2\cm$ of the beam line.
\item \textbf{Beam Halo Filter} - beam halos are machine induced particles (\eg beam-gas, beam-pipe interactions) which circulate with the beam at radii up to 5m. The filter removes events with calorimeter and muon chamber energy deposits consistent with either halo particles or particle showers caused by halos interacting with the collimator blocks that used to clean halos from the beam.
\item \textbf{HBHE Noise and Isolation Filters} - removes events where anomalous noise is present in the HCAL's hybrid photodiodes or readout boxes, which registers as large isolated energy deposits which would infer the presence of large \MET, by considering the channel multiplicities, pulse shape of the readout and the neighbouring activity in the calorimeters and tracker.
\item \textbf{ECAL Trigger Primitive Filter} - the L1 trigger primitive readout can be used to estimate the energy deposited in approximately 70\% of the channels which lack regular data links and are masked out for reconstruction. As trigger the primitives have a narrower energy acceptance range than the read-out, when the energy is near their saturation energy the measured energy is likely to be underestimated, resulting in high anomalous \MET. 
%\item \textbf{ECAL Endcap SC Filters} - NOT recommended for 2016
\item \textbf{Bad Charged Hadron Filter} - removes events where a muon is not defined as a PF muon due to its low quality, but makes its way into the PF MET calculation as a charged hadron candidate.
\item \textbf{Bad Muon Filter} - removes events where a muon is defined as a PF muon, but is still has too low a quality and large \pT to be considered.
\end{itemize}

\section{Physics Objects}\label{sec:eventSelection}
This section discusses the various selection criteria this analysis applies to the physics objects which have been identified and reconstructed using the particle flow algorithm described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:data-mc}.

\subsection{Lepton Selection}
All PF electrons and muons considered must pass a set of kinematic requirements and a set identification criteria defined by CMS.
The kinematic requirements are applied to ensure that the leptons lie within detector acceptance and that their transverse momenta occupies the phase-space where the lepton trigger turn-on is well described.
The identification criteria have been designed to be efficient at selecting isolated prompt leptons and rejecting leptons which have been produced non-promptly from decays from within jets or taus or from incorrectly reconstructed tracks.

Different working points are used by identification criteria defined by CMS, where the lepton selection efficiency is traded off against the purity of the leptons selected.
For both lepton flavours the ``tightest'' working point is used to select high purity collections of leptons, with the ``loosest'' working point used to veto events with any additional leptons.

\subsubsection{Electrons}\label{subsubsec:electronSelection}
For any PF electron candidate to be considered it must meet the following kinematic requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \pt of the leading and subleading electrons considered must be greater than the 35\GeVc and 15\GeVc respectively.
\item electrons must have $|\eta| \leq 2.50$ to ensure that the electrons are within the ECAL acceptance.
\item as accurate reconstruction cannot be undertaken in the transition region between the ECAL barrel and endcap, electrons with $1.4442 \leq \eta \leq 1.566$ are not considered.
\item the longitudinal impact parameter, $d_{z}$, of the electron must be less than 0.10\cm in the barrel and 0.20\cm in the endcap disks.
\item the transverse impact parameter, $d_{0}$, of the electron must be less than 0.05\cm in the barrel and 0.10\cm in the endcap disks.
\end{itemize}

The \emph{tight} and \emph{veto} working points of the \emph{cut based} identification criteria which are approximately  70\% and 95\% efficient respectively, are used to select electrons and to veto any additional electrons.
The cut based identification uses a mixture of manually set and multivariate analysis (MVA) tuned variables for btoh the barrel and endcap disks.

The manually set variables are:
\item \textbf{the expected number of missing hits in the inner tracker} - as photons do not leave hits in the tracker, if 
\item \textbf{a conversion veto} - is applied for all working points, where any electron which fails the electron conversion veto is rejected.

The MVA tuned variables include:
\item \textbf{} - the shower shape variable, which describes the shape of the shower in $\eta$.
\iten \itembf{} - the distances in $\eta$ and $\phi$ between the ECAL supercluster and where the track has been extrapolated to from the primary vertex.
\item \textbf{} - 
\item the relative isolation of the electron, which is described further in Chapter~\ref{subsubsec:relIso}.
\item 1/E - 1/p

The ECAL crystal which contains the largest energy deposit is considered to be the \emph{seed crystal} for the purpose of these cuts.

\subsubsection{Muons}\label{subsubsec:muonSelection}
Similar to the electrons, PF muons are required to meet a set of kinematic requirements and identification criteria.

In the case of the former set of requirements, muons candidates are required to have:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}



Tight  
suppress hadronic punch-through into the muon system and non-prompt muons.
\begin{itemize}
\item is a PF Muon and is also both a tracker and global muon.
\item the $\chi^{2}/ndf$ of the global muon track fit is less than ten. 
\item at least one muon chamber is included in the global track fit.
\item that muon segments are found in at least two muon stations.
\item $d_{0} < 0.2\cm$ and $d_{z} < 0.5\cm$.
\item the muon must have at least one hit in the pixel detector.
\item hits must be present in at least six tracker layers in order to achieve a good \pT.
\end{itemize}

Loose muons are defined 
\begin{itemize}
\item is both a PF muon and is also either a tracker or global muon
\end{itemize}

loose rel iso = 0.98

\subsubsection{Lepton Isolation}\label{subsubsec:relIso}
\editComment{more detail}
In order to differentiate between leptons promptly produced at the primary vertex from those that result from hadronic decay and to enable a precise momentum measurement by ensuring they are sufficiently separated from hadrons and photons, a relative isolation variable $I^{rel}$ is defined.
The isolation variable is defined as the summed energy of all PF particles within a cone around the PF lepton, with the estimated neutral charged pileup contamination, $\rho$, removed, divided by the lepton \pT.

Two different pileup contamination estimation methods are used in the analysis presented, one for electrons and the other for muons.

For electrons, the $\rho$ * effective area ($rho * A_{eff}$) pileup alleviation technique is used.
This method involves the estimating the expected energy within the isolation cone from the median energy density per area of pileup contamination, estimated for each event, with the effective area given as a function of the electron's pseudorapidity.

This is given as: 

\begin{equation}
I^{rel}_{rho * A_{eff}} = \sum p_T(CH) + max (0.0, \sum E_{\rm T}(NH) + \sum E_{\rm T}(Photon) -rho*A_{\rm eff} )/p_T \\
\end{equation}\label{eq:rhoEffA}

Muons employ the $\Delta\beta$ pileup alleviation technique, where the average pileup energy inside the cone is estimated as half of that originating from charged hadrons.
This is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
I^{rel}_{\Delta\beta} = \sum p_T(CH) + max (0.0, \sum E_{\rm T}(NH) + \sum E_{\rm T}(Photon) - 0.5 * \sum E_{\rm T}(PU))/p_T \\
\end{equation}\label{eq:deltaBeta}

Where CH is the charged hadrons from the Primary Vertex (PV), NH is the neutral hadrons and PU the charged hadrons from pileup.

\subsubsection{Z Boson Candidate Invariant Mass Requirements}
The presence of a Z boson in the final state requires that two leptons selected must be consistent with a Z boson decay.
Therefore, the leptons must have the same flavour and opposite charge and an invariant mass within 20\GeVcc of the known Z mass.
%This mass window was determined on the basis of 
%including sufficient signal events 

\subsection{Jet, b-tagging and W Boson Candidate Requirements}
\subsubsection{Jet Requirements}
Jets are considered from the PF jet collection which reconstructs jets using the \emph{anti-\kt} algorithm with R = 0.4 with charged hadrons originating from \PU vertices excluded from clustering.
Following identification, the jet energy corrections are applied as described in Chapter~\ref{subsubsec:JECs}.

Jets are considered in the analysis if they have a $\pT > 30\GeVc$, are within $|\eta| < 4.7$ and meet the \emph{loose} working point jet identification criteria developed by CMS.
Additionally, selected leptons (electron or muon) which lie within a cone of $\Delta R = 0.4$ of a selected jet are not considered to be a prompt leptons and instead part of the jet in question.

The loose jet ID was designed to reject the majority of the fake tracks produced from detector and/or electronics noise whilst maintaining a high selection efficiency for real jets by requiring all jets to have part of their energy deposited in both the ECAL and HCAL and be composed of more than one particle.

\editComment{Necessary to spell this out? Or comment out ...}
The loose jet identification criteria are as follows:

for jets with $\eta \leq 2.70$ the loose ID criteria are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fraction of the jet energy from both neutral electromagnetic particles in the ECAL and neutral hadronic particles in the HCAL is less than $0.99$.
\item at least two constituent particles are present.
\end{itemize}

with these applying in addition for $\eta \leq 2.40$:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fraction of the jet energy from charged electromagnetic particles in the ECAL is less than $0.99$ and greater than 0.0 for charged hadronic particles in the HCAL.
\item at least one charged particle is present.
\end{itemize}


for jets with $ 2.70 \leq \eta \leq 3.0$ the loose ID criteria are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fraction of the jet energy from neutral electromagnetic particles in the ECAL is greater than than $0.01$ and less than $0.98$ for neutral hadronic particles in the HCAL.
\item at least three neutral particles are present.
\end{itemize}

and for jets with $\eta > 3.0$ the loose ID criteria are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the fraction of the jet energy in the ECAL that is from neutral electromagnetic particles is less than $0.90$.
\item at least eleven neutral particles are present.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{b-tagging}
The CSVv2 tagging algorithm described in Chapter~\ref{subsec:objReco-bJets} is used to tag jets, with a working point (WP) cut applied to the b-tag discriminator.
If the value of a jet's discriminator exceeds that of the Medium WP and has $|\eta| < 2.40$, the jet is considered to be a b-jet.
From the \emph{Loose}, \emph{Medium} and \emph{Tight} WPs defined by CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2017ezt}, as given in Table~\ref{tab:bTagWPs} in Chapter~\ref{subsec:objReco-bJets}, the Medium WP was chosen as it provided the optimum performance in terms of providing as large statistics as possible for the signal process without too great a compromise on the purity of the selection.

\subsubsection{W Boson Candidate Invariant Mass Requirements}
In contrast to the previous tZq searches where the W boson decays into a lepton and its associated antineutrino, the W boson in the dilepton final state decays hadronically, allowing for the top quark to be fully reconstructed.
The W boson candidate is constructed by considering each possible pair of jets, with the pair with a dijet invariant mass closest to the known W boson mass of 80.4\GeVcc being chosen as the W candidate.
The leading b-jet however, is excluded from consideration as the hardest b-jet is assumed to be produced from the decay of the top quark. 

\subsection{\MET}\label{subsec:met}
Whilst the signal region does not explicitly cut on \MET, it is used in one of the Z+jets control regions, described in Chatper~\ref{subsec:zPlusJetsCR}, and in the boosted decision tree, discussed in Chapter~\ref{subsec:bdt}, in order to discriminate against backgrounds such as \ttbar which do feature significant amounts of \MET.

\section{Data and MC Simulation Samples}\label{sec:samples}
The analysis uses proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{13}$ in 2016, considering events in the double lepton and single lepton datasets where the double and single lepton triggers respectively have fired, using the strategy described in Chapter~\ref{sec:triggerStrategy}.

Table~\ref{tab:mcList} lists the MC samples used to simulate the signal and background processes that were considered.
 with the number of events generated, their cross sections and 
 
 the generator used and the order in perturbative accuracy in QCD was used to produce them.

Additional simulated samples 
The hadronisation of all the MC samples considered was done using PYTHIA 8.

\section{Simulation Corrections}\label{sec:simCorrections}
As 

\subsection{Miscalibrated Tracker APV}
During the first half of data taking in 2016 the silicon strip detector suffered from instantaneous luminosity dependent  hit finding inefficiencies, particularly in high occupancy regions, due to saturation in the pre-amplifier in the front end electronics~\cite{Fiori:2016ebh}.
This issue was resolved by changing the configuration of the electronics.
While the affected part of the dataset has been reprocessed to mitigate the impact on the quality of the data taken, there is still a negative impact on the detector efficiency for objects that rely upon highly efficient tracking data.
This is accounted for by the weighting of events appropriately when the scale factors are produced, either centrally by CMS or those derived for the analysis (\ie the trigger scale factors), so that a single scale factor is applied to a simulated event.

%In most cases, centrally produced scale factors are derived for the whole of the 2016 dataset to account for this, but 
%for muons they were provided for both the affected and unaffected parts of the dataset separately.
%Consequently, the muon scale factors were weighted according to the luminosity they corresponded to before their application to simulation.
%Similarly, the muon trigger scale factors that were derived were also produced

\section{Signal Region}\label{sec:signalRegion}
The signal enriched region event selection was designed select signal events with a high efficiency whilst rejecting as much of the background process as possible.

non-prompt, Z+jets, ttZ

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:feyn_tZq}, at leading order tZq consists of a top quark, a recoil quark and a radiated Z boson.
Therefore the 

The 

No \MET cut is applied in the signal region event selection despite there being no \MET directly produced by the signal process.
This decision was taken as it was ...

\section{Control Regions}\label{sec:controlRegions}
In any high energy particle physics analysis, accurate modelling of the background processes is essential in order to be able to make a measurement.
As the main challenge in searching for the dilepton final state of tZq is that the signal region is dominated by background processes, it particularly important to ensure that the background processes are accurately modelled in simulation.
In order to confirm whether or not a data-driven estimations are required, background enriched control regions which are topologically similar and orthogonal to the signal region are used for the two largest background processes are defined.
The same trigger, event cleaning, number of oppositely charged leptons, number of jets required and W and Z boson mass selection criteria are applied to the control regions so that they occupy a topologically similar phase space to the signal region.
Where required, these control regions are extrapolated to provide a data-driven estimation of the background in the signal region as discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:dataDrivenBackground}.

\subsection{Z+jets Background Control Regions}\label{subsec:zPlusJetsCR}
Despite the majority of such events being rejected by the signal region criteria, given the large cross section for Z+jets, the remaining events from this process dominate the signal region to form the single largest background.
Given the size of this background and the difficulties in accurately modelling higher order contributions from QCD processes, it is essential to ensure that both the normalisation and modelling of the jets for this background are well described.

Initially a high statistics Z+jets enriched control region was defined by requiring that none of the jets present are b-tagged, in contrast to the one to two required for the signal region, in order to 
Given that the
large statistics 


Despite the good description of the jet multiplicity and jet \pT shapes in this control region, discussed in depth in Chapter~\ref{subsec:zPlusJetsEstimation}, the lack of b-tagged jets could 
as differing kinematics of the final event selection 

Therefore an alternative Z+jets enriched control region was defined by requiring same b-jet selection (one to two b-jets) as the signal region but with the W boson mass cut inverted in order to 

To ensure that the leptons selected are produced from a Z boson decay, a \MET cut of 50\GeV is used to suppress \ttbar where significant quantities of \MET are expected from the leptonically decaying W bosons.

The application of both of these control regions is discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:dataDrivenBackground}.

\subsection{\ttbar Background Control Region}\label{subsec:ttbarCR}
\ttbar events form the second largest background process, where events with two leptons produced from W bosons decaying having an invariant mass which is compatible with the Z boson mass window in the being selected in the signal region.
The selection criteria for the \ttbar control region differs from the signal region definition defined in Chapter~\ref{sec:signalRegion}, by requiring that the two oppositely leptons selected to have different flavours (\ie one is an electron and the other a muon).
%The electron and muon \pt thresholds are modified from those given in Chapters~\ref{subsubsec:electronSelection} and~\ref{subsubsec:muonSelection} as the leading lepton \pt thresholds of the HLT paths considered for the e$\mu$ final state, as given in Chapter~\ref{sec:triggerStrategy}, differ from those for the same flavour final states.

As the branching ratio for a W boson (produced by the top quark and anti-top quark decays) to decay into either an electron or muon is the same, this produces a \ttbar enriched background control region which is topologically similar to the \ttbar contributions in the signal region.
