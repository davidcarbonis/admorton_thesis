\title{
Search for the Production of a Single Top Quark in association with a Z Boson at the LHC 
}

\author{Alexander D. J. Morton}

\maketitle

\abstract{
A search for the production of a single top quark in association with a Z boson and an additional jet using data from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is presented.
This is a rare process that is predicted by the Standard Model 
This search focussed on identifying the final state containing two leptons from the Z boson decay, two jets from the decay of the W boson produced by the top quark decay, a b-jet from the top quark decay and a recoil jet.
The signal was dominated by backgrounds involving a real Z boson or two promptly produced leptons consist with a Z boson decay, primarily Z+jet and top quark pair production.
As such, a Boosted Decision Tree was used to enhance the separation between the signal and background processes.
Using a dataset corresponding to 35.8\fbinv, a limit on the production cross section has been set at $X_{Y}^{Z}$ fb.
This corresponds to an OBSERVED/EXPECTED signal significance of $999 \sigma$ when compared to the background only hypothesis, which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction and the limits set by searches for the final state where the Z boson and W boson decay leptonically.

The CMS experiment's new tracking detector at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider will require the ability to reconstruct all charged tracks with transverse momentum greater than 2-3\GeV within 4\mus so that they can be used in the Level-1 trigger decision.
One of the proposed track finders is an FPGA-based based solution using a fully time-multiplexed architecture, where track candidates are reconstructed using a projective binning algorithm based on the Hough Transform.
Studies into the suitability of a linearised $\chi^{2}$ algorithm for fitting track parameters were undertaken and it was found that its performance was inferior compared to that of a combinatorial \KF fitter.
The impact of reducing the minimum track transverse momentum from 3\GeV to 2\GeV on the proposed system was also evaluated.
The resulting degradation of of performance was found to be recoverable by improving the handling of multiple scattering in the track finding and fitting algorithms.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements} \label{sec:acknowledgments}
This thesis would not have been possible without the time, help, thoughts, and advice of many people.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor \textit{Joanne Cole} for her continual support, guidance and advice over the course of the last four years.
I am not sure how I can ever express my gratitude for her ability to always find the time for me and for the uncountable number of corrections she made to this thesis.

I would also like to thank \textit{Catherine Mackay} and \textit{Corin Hoad} in particular for their work on the statistical analysis of the tZq analysis presented in this thesis.
Without both of their efforts I doubt I would have survived 
My thanks go to \textit{Ivan Reid} whose 


I would like to thank all those I've worked with throughout the UK CMS Collaboration and during my time at CERN.

Finally, but most importantly, I would like to thank \textit{Peter Hobson} and the Science and Technologies Facilities Council.
Without them, I would not have had the privilege of being able to embark on this work.
